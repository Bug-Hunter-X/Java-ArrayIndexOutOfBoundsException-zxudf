# Java ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException Bug

This repository demonstrates a common Java error: an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The `bug.java` file contains code that incorrectly iterates through an array, causing an exception when it attempts to access an index that is out of bounds.  The `bugSolution.java` file shows the corrected code.  This is a frequent error that highlights the importance of careful array index management in Java.

## How to Reproduce
1. Compile `bug.java`.
2. Run the compiled code.  You will observe an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.
3. Compile and run `bugSolution.java` to see the corrected version.
